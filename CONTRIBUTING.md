## Local setup

The easiest way to make a local development setup is creating a Cloudera VM and starting this exporter with Makefile.

```sh
vim config.ini
# Check the host and port parameters on [target] section to your Cloudera VM network configuration.
# This exporter can resolve Domain Names if you set up on host parameter, but you need a DNS with the Domain Name of the Cloudera VM to resolve the requests.
# Version parameter is not mandatory, this exporter try to get this value for itself.

# Set up the username and password params on [user] section to your Cloudera VM credentials.

# On [modules] section you can set true/false for enable or disable a scrape module.

# On [system] section you can change the IP and port for deploy this exporter, the number of process to paralelice the scrape process and the level of log.

make local

# Go to this URL http://<YOUR_DEPLOY_IP>:<PORT>/metrics
```
